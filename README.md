What will be included in your appâ€™s description and what kind of icon will best represent your app once it is made available in the app store?
The app I developed is a weight tracking and fitness app, this helps the users maintain and achive weight goals they set for themselves
They can do this by tracking weakly rates and also caloric intake and useage to help balance their life. I think the best Icon
for my application within a app store would be a weight scale or a human figure appearing to be in motion.

Which version(s) of Android will your app successfully run on? Have you included the most current version? Note that with each version of Android, new components are introduced that add considerations and challenges in the development.
This application should run successfully on 4.3-4.3.1

What permissions will your app ask for? Be sure these are only permissions that are necessary for your app to run. For example, does your manifest ask for permission to record phone audio when your app does not use it?
This app will ask permission to location and contacts to help refer friends and see how much activity the person is doing along with 
allow you to share with friends as a friendly competition or to invite them to join the app.

What is your plan for monetization of the app? Consider whether your app will include ads, require a one-time payment, both, or neither.
There will be a free version of the app, or a version they can pay for in yearly. That being siad allowing more access for people who pay for the app. A secondary option
to consider is the add version so you can have more access to things, not all but more then the free by watch adds throughout the app.
